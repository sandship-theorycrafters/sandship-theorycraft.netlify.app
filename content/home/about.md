The compendium is split into several different “sections” based on the base resource of each build. Recycler, Underwell and “everything” builds will get their own section. Each section will consist of the following:

1. A general overview to the resource and its use
2. The end product of the resource

   1. Best build no importers for the end product
   2. Best build with importers for the end product
   3. Best build for newer players (wip right now)
   4. Best build that doesn’t fit in a 12x12 micro factory
3. Other builds and points of interests, 

Note that step 2 will be repeated for all end products, every single one of them! This will make the list pretty long, so I recommend using the table of contents. 

I also want to say thank you to the theorycrafting sub-discord for helping me make this, along with all the awesome people who made these builds. Also the Rockbite cause they made this fun game

Also, if you (yes, you the reader) have a terrific design that is better than the ones listed, please dm me a picture of them, along with some stability info. (My discord username is SharkyTheWhale#0073)
