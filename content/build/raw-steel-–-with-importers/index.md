As of the time of posting, one of the most compact 22.5/s steel builds yet. For some odd reason, the bottom three rows somehow stabilize the build. They also offer steel rod/plate/shaper recipe generation utilizing only 20/s of steel, which, in theory should be the most efficient way to make steel rod/plate/shaper recipe for now.
