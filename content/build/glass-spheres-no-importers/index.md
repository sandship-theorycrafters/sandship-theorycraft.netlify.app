A build for glass spheres. Starts with 5 synths at the bottom, with grabbers+splitter trick being used to collect a lot of silicon. It is refined once through a heater into glass, again through a blower for glass tubes and a final time for glass spheres, it is then exported. Also, I’m pretty damn sure that there are extra blowers towards the top and some spare conveyors in between sets of blowers, so don’t copy those. Semi modular, so parts can be replaced for glass/glass tubes
