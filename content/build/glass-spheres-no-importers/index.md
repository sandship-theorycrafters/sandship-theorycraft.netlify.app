A build for glass spheres. Starts with 5 synths at the bottom, with grabbers+splitter trick being used to collect a lot of silicon. It is refined once through a heater into glass, again through a blower for glass tubes and a final time for glass spheres, it is then exported. \
the excess stuff (blowers and belts) are used to adjust the factory to make glass plates or tubes
