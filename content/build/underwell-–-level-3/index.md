Uses 3 resonators, producing 1.5 everstone/second. The result of me messing with overloading a single turret with ammo, and then realizing I could ise that to make a cool build

**Sharky The Whale’s wise words of wisdom: Random things I found out when making this build. 1. Having multiple lines of ammo feeding into one turret is really effective. 2. Resonators and guns block line of sight of weapons. Nothing else seems to (among the things you should put there. I’d didn’t test extruders)**
