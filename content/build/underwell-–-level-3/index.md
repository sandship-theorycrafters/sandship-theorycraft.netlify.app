Uses 3 resonators, producing 1.5 everstone/second. This version used walls, I changed to extruders as it is much more stable in terms of producing 1.5 everstone per second. Design edited by Ap0them, from DA ENGIN33R's design.

**Sharky The Whale’s wise words of wisdom: with the new update, walls should be better than extruders. I don’t know why apothem changed DA ENGIN33R’s build to extruders, but just use walls. For my sanity. I’d prefer more guns but... I’ll take what I can get**
