Uses 3 resonators, producing 1.5 everstone/second. Honour>Results. This version is an improved version of spatzl’s design, as throughput was a little iffy.

**\*Sharky’s wise words if wisdom:** This build may be honorable for not using extruders as walls, but it lacks glory. Needs a hell of a lot more guns if you ask me*
