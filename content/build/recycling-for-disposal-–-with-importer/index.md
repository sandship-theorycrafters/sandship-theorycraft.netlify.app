A recycling build. It may not be the most efficient in terms of money/substance, but it’s good for dumping extra resources for a bit of cash. Uses importers, so be careful as the importer bug may occur. Ap0them edited from Patytsung's design, while this is less stable, it only fluctuates by about 2.28, meaning the lowest rates still beat Patytsung's design
